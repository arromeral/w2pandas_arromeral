## Description
The project consists of cleaning and wrangling a database imported from the following csv document [Sharks](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teajay/global-shark-attacks) which contains records of shark attacks from 1703 to 2018.

Each record includes a large number of attributes, in many cases with very little consistency and without a clear pattern. Also, a large number of records and some columns from the original set are practically useless due to the large number of null values â€‹â€‹they contain.

During this project i will try to clean and establish homogenization criteria until obtaining a DataFrame that can be used to carry out different analyzes based on the relevant data of the document.

Likewise, I will perform some analyzes with the DataFrame once cleaned.
