## Description
The project consists of cleaning and wrangling a database imported from the following csv document [Sharks](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teajay/global-shark-attacks) which contains records of shark attacks from 1703 to 2018.

Each record includes a large number of attributes, in many cases with very little consistency and without a clear pattern. Also, a large number of records and some columns from the original set are practically useless due to the large number of null values â€‹â€‹they contain.

During this project i will try to clean and establish homogenization criteria until obtaining a DataFrame that can be used to carry out different analyzes based on the relevant data of the document.

Likewise, I will perform some analyzes with the DataFrame once cleaned.
## Contents
The contents of the project are as follows:
- [src folder](https://github.com/arromeral/w2pandas_arromeral/tree/main/src):
  - [jaws.ipynb](https://github.com/arromeral/w2pandas_arromeral/blob/main/src/jaws.ipynb): Jupyter notebook with the main code used to clean and obtain results.
  - [funclean.ipynb](https://github.com/arromeral/w2pandas_arromeral/blob/main/src/funclean.ipynb): Jupyter notebook with some custom functions to clean and categorize columns used in jaws.ipynb.
-[images](https://github.com/arromeral/w2pandas_arromeral/tree/main/images): Folders with some pictures of charts obtained during the analysis.
-[attacks.csv](https://github.com/arromeral/w2pandas_arromeral/blob/main/attacks.csv): original csv document with raw data.
-[attacks_clean.csv](https://github.com/arromeral/w2pandas_arromeral/blob/main/attacks_clean.csv): final csv document exported with clean data.
-[paises.csv](https://github.com/arromeral/w2pandas_arromeral/blob/main/paises.csv): csv document containing the ISO2 and ISO3 codes of most countries and their name in several languages.
